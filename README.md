# Brightness Control
#### A native macOS solution for controlling external monitors through DDC/CI.

This is my first SwiftUI app. I tried to make the app feel as native as possible by making the UI look like the one from control center. The app supports changing the brightness of external displays either from the menu bar window (individually for any display) or the `F1`, `F2` keys (for all displays). The app also supports turning on/off external monitors.
